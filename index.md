# About
I'm a Research Associate at the [Institute of Applied Computational Sciences](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu) at Harvard University, working on machine learning research in the Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) lab. Currently, I am interested in uncertainty estimation for deep models; more broadly, I am interested in building models with gauranteed properties that align with task-specific desiderata, such as interpretability, risk-awareness, satifaction of domain-specific constraints. 

In a former life, I did research in pure math (specifically algebraic topology) and was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Saint Mary's College of California.
